# Adaptive-Multi-Scale-Edge-Detection-for-IRIS

Multi-scale smoothing using average kernels of varying sizes (3×3 to 13×13).

Edge enhancement through high-pass filtering (difference between fine and coarse smoothing).

Gradient computation using horizontal and vertical Sobel operators.

Adaptive thresholding with Otsu’s method and percentile-based gradient filtering.

Edge connection refinement, filling small discontinuities in horizontal and vertical directions using customizable connection length L.

Visualization of edge detection results across multiple filter scales.
